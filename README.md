# TimelinePTC

## Overview
TimelinePTC is a cutting-edge, web-based tool designed to revolutionize the collection and analysis of Pathways to Care (PTC) data in First Episode Psychosis (FEP) research. This tool addresses the crucial need for an accurate measurement of the Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) by providing a digital platform for collaborative, real-time data entry and visualization. Initially developed for the Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP) program in New Haven, Connecticut, TimelinePTC's design and open-source nature facilitate easy adaptation to various healthcare contexts.

## Features
- **Intuitive Data Entry and Visualization**: Offers a user-friendly interface for data entry and visualization, enhancing data accuracy and collection efficiency.
- **Automated Data Conversion**: Automates the conversion of collected data into a format ready for analysis, reducing manual transcription errors.
- **Flexible and Adaptable**: Designed to be easily adaptable for different healthcare settings, thanks to its open-source codebase.
- **Telehealth Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with telehealth settings, allowing for real-time, remote collaboration between clinic staff and participants.
